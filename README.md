Each file represents the weighted and directed adjacency matrix of the marked year and month. Each weighted directed edge (u, v; k) âˆˆ E(G) corresponds to the amount of money k that is owed by the country u to the country v ($ amounts in USD).

## Example
Consider the file 2000 Aug.csv, we see that:
- Belgium owes Austria $2,197 USD
- Austria owes Belgium $4,929 USD
